# The Alexandria Project
A simple python script that takes in a site map and submits everything in it to web.archive.org.
# Usage
Make sure you have all the dependencies at the top.
Run it from the command line with 
```python
python alexandria.py <full sitemap url>
```
For example:
```python
python alexandria.py https://www.nasa.gov/sitemap-1.xml
```
To find a website's sitemap you can usually go to <site>/sitemap.xml and view source to find the sitemap in parts.
